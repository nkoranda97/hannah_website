<h2> Abstract </h2>
The hydrogen isotopic composition (δ2H values) of plant waxes preserved in the sedimentary record is a useful proxy for past hydroclimate, but a number of known biological and environmental factors can confound the climate signal this proxy records. High-latitude ecology and environmental conditions differ from those of the better-studied low latitudes, and the influence of arctic conditions on factors that affect δ2H records of climate is poorly constrained. Direct observations of arctic plant waxes and their δ2H values, particularly from aquatic plants, are very limited. Here we present a study of n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid homologue distributions, δ2H values, and δ13C values from west Greenland, including measurements of terrestrial and aquatic plants, algae, and Nostoc (colonial cyanobacteria). By examining samples collected from the same region and season, we focus on climate-independent factors that may affect the δ2H values of sedimentary plant waxes. We observe that the average abundance of leaf n-alkyl lipids (C20-C31) in common terrestrial plants from this region exceeds that in aquatic sources by up to 30×. We also note weaker source specificity in n-alkanoic acids than in n-alkanes. A comparison of these data with surface sedimentary plant waxes from a lake within the study area, previously reported by McFarlin et al. (2019), indicates that at this site both mid-chain and long-chain sedimentary waxes are likely to derive from dominantly terrestrial sources, particularly biased towards the genus Salix. Abundance-weighted isotope data reveal that while terrestrial plants show taxonomic trends in δ2H values, the amplitude of these trends is unlikely to exceed the error of the proxy (the standard deviation on calculated εapp). n-Alkane εapp values are more variable in aquatic than in terrestrial sources, with median values ranging from −115‰ in n-C31 to −143‰ in n-C21. However, because sedimentary waxes at our study site are most similar to terrestrial plants for all homologues (in isotopic composition and proportional abundance), the large variability in aquatic εapp is unlikely to strongly impact sedimentary wax δ2H values here and in comparable environments. Our findings do not support using comparisons of mid- and long-chain homologues to infer differences between lake water and precipitation without independent validation of the source of mid-chain waxes. Nevertheless, we show that homologue abundance, δ2H values, and δ13C values of sedimentary n-alkanes can inform wax-based reconstructions of paleoclimate at high latitudes. This work provides new insights into the wax contributions from west Greenland plant communities and highlights important areas for future studies of arctic plants and plant wax proxies.

<h2> Introduction </h2>
The Arctic is rapidly warming, and this trend is expected to intensify with time (Serreze et al., 2009, Screen and Simmonds, 2010, Serreze and Barry, 2011). Ongoing warming has contributed to permafrost thaw, shortened cold seasons with earlier melt-out, and Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss over at least the last two decades (Smith et al., 2005, Hanna et al., 2008, Vaughan et al., 2013). These landscape changes illustrate the strong connection between temperature and hydrology in the Arctic. With warmer temperatures, climate models indicate that precipitation amounts in the high latitudes will increase over the coming century (Collins et al., 2013, Kirtman et al., 2013). To continue to assess model fidelity against past known periods of warming, robust records of past hydroclimate are needed. Accurate climate reconstructions are thus vital for assessing how future warming might affect local precipitation across the Arctic.
An important tool used to understand past changes in arctic hydroclimate is the hydrogen isotopic composition (δ2H) of sedimentary plant waxes, namely n-alkanes (Pagani et al., 2006, Jahren et al., 2009, Nichols et al., 2009, Balascio et al., 2013, Balascio et al., 2018b, Muschitiello et al., 2015, Keisling et al., 2017, Thomas et al., 2018, Curtin et al., 2019) and n-alkanoic acids (Nichols et al., 2009, Thomas et al., 2012, Thomas et al., 2016, Curtin et al., 2019). The δ2H values of precipitation are controlled by a suite of climate parameters and hydrologic processes that includes temperature, distillation, aridity, and moisture source (Dansgaard, 1964, Gat, 1996). Plant waxes isotopically reflect hydrogen isotope equilibrium with the plant’s source water, and recent work has demonstrated that the average apparent fractionation factor (εapp) between δ2H values of some plant wax homologues in surface sediments and those of local precipitation is remarkably consistent on a global scale, including at high-latitude and high-altitude sites (Sachse et al., 2012, Liu and An, 2019, McFarlin et al., 2019).
This relationship provides the foundation for reconstructing local precipitation δ2H values from the δ2H values of sedimentary plant waxes. However, prior research has identified variability up to 125‰ in wax δ2H values across individual plants from the same locality and up to 110‰ across compounds within a single species (e.g. Duan and Xu, 2012, Feakins, 2013, Wilkie et al., 2013, Eley et al., 2014, Berke et al., 2019). This variability is attributable to a number of processes affecting wax production, including leaf conditions at time of wax synthesis, plant growth form, metabolic processes, source water, and rooting depth (Feakins and Sessions, 2010, Polissar and Freeman, 2010, Castañeda and Schouten, 2011, Sachse et al., 2012, Tipple et al., 2013, Freimuth et al., 2017). While this biological and environmental variability averages out in global calibrations (Sachse et al., 2012, McFarlin et al., 2019), in some localities it can strongly influence δ2H values of sedimentary plant waxes independent of changes in δ2H of precipitation (e.g. Feakins, 2013). This can confound the interpretation of sedimentary plant wax δ2H values for reconstructing climate, particularly in regions like the Arctic that are underrepresented in modern plant and sedimentary wax compilations (Liu and An, 2019, McFarlin et al., 2019).
Unique growth conditions in the Arctic merit investigation of modern plant waxes for comparison against existing data from other regions. At the highest latitudes, plant growth occurs during a short, cool summer with near-constant sunlight, and rooting depth is sometimes limited by permafrost (Nielsen, 2010, Iversen et al., 2015). Further, the seasonal range in average δ2H values of precipitation in the Arctic can be upwards of 100‰ (Bowen and Revenaugh, 2003, Bowen et al., 2005, Bowen et al., 2018, Bowen, 2020), which can result in large differences between the δ2H values of soil water and mean annual precipitation (MAP) where one season dominates the local hydrologic budget (McFarlin et al., 2019, Cluett and Thomas, 20). All of these climatic and ecological factors characteristic of the Arctic may confound the interpretation of sedimentary wax records using globally calibrated plant-water εapp values (e.g. Liu and Yang, 2008, Yang et al., 2009). An examination of arctic plant wax δ2H patterns will provide insights into the global relationship between wax and precipitation δ2H values in these critically understudied locations.
To examine the controls on sedimentary wax δ2H records, it is necessary to identify the origin of those sedimentary waxes. Plant waxes are produced by both terrestrial and aquatic plants, but different growth waters are available to each: terrestrial plants access soil water, whereas freshwater aquatic plants access lake water. While both soil and lake water ultimately derive from precipitation at most sites, they can be subject to different evaporative conditions and residence times, which is reflected in differences in their δ2H values (Gibson and Edwards, 2002, Leng and Anderson, 2003). As a result, understanding the contributions of terrestrial and aquatic plants to a time-integrated sedimentary plant wax record is important in evaluating the hydrologic signals recorded by wax δ2H values.
There is a substantial body of work relating different chain lengths of plant waxes, referred to as “homologues,” to their plant sources. Long-chain n-alkanes, particularly homologues > n-C25, are recognized as the primary component of vascular terrestrial plants’ epicuticle (Eglinton et al., 1962, Eglinton and Hamilton, 1967). Countless studies have reproduced this observation, and a meta-analysis of plant n-alkane studies found that n-alkanes > n-C25 made up >70% of total odd n-alkanes (n-C21–n-C35) in vascular terrestrial plants of many growth forms across mid- and low-latitude sites (Bush and McInerney, 2013). Meanwhile, mid-chain n-alkanes (n-C21–n-C25) have largely been identified as the dominant alkane homologues in non-vascular and aquatic plants (Ficken et al., 2000, Sachse et al., 2006, Aichner et al., 2010a, Gao et al., 2011), though some studies have found that longer homologues dominate in some species (Wang and Liu, 2012, Liu and Liu, 2017, Balascio et al., 2018a). Emergent aquatic plants primarily yield homologue distributions similar to terrestrial plants (i.e. dominantly long-chain waxes), but prior studies have developed metrics to distinguish between the two groups as sources of sedimentary waxes (Ficken et al., 2000, Gao et al., 2011). In contrast to n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acid homologue distributions are more similar across aquatic, emergent aquatic, and terrestrial plants (Liu and Liu, 2017, Freimuth et al., 2019). However, some observations of terrestrial and submerged aquatic plant n-alkanoic acid distributions support a dominance of n-C28 and n-C30 alkanoic acids in some vascular terrestrial plants and n-C20 and n-C24 alkanoic acids in some submerged aquatic plants (Nichols et al., 2009, Gao et al., 2011, Wang and Liu, 2012).
Based on these trends in wax homologue distribution by plant growth form, paleoclimate reconstructions generally use long-chain waxes to represent terrestrial plant input to the sediment record and mid-chain waxes to represent aquatic plant input. Extending this logic, some studies in both low- and high-latitude regions apply long- and mid-chain homologue δ2H values to reconstruct precipitation (soil water) and lake water δ2H values, respectively (Hou et al., 2006, Shuman et al., 2006, Jacob et al., 2007, Mügler et al., 2008, Seki et al., 2011, Guenther et al., 2013, Rao et al., 2014, Thomas et al., 2016, Thomas et al., 2018, Rach et al., 2017a, Rach et al., 2017b, Aichner et al., 2019). While several studies have tested this framework for reconstructing hydrologic balance (Mügler et al., 2008, Rao et al., 2014, Rach et al., 2017b), it is subject to a few important limitations.
First, wax homologue distributions by plant growth form do not adhere to expectations in all environments. Aquatic plant waxes are only sometimes dominated by mid-chain homologues (Ficken et al., 2000, Gao et al., 2011, Wang and Liu, 2012, Liu and Liu, 2017). Arctic terrestrial plants also vary across species with respect to their dominant n-alkane homologues, but these observations are sparse relative to low-latitude studies (Ficken et al., 2000, Jansen et al., 2006, Diefendorf et al., 2011, Gao et al., 2011, Duan and Xu, 2012, Bush and McInerney, 2013, Wilkie et al., 2013, Thomas et al., 2016, Daniels et al., 2017, Daniels et al., 2018, Berke et al., 2019, Freimuth et al., 2019). Few arctic aquatic plants have been analyzed for their wax homologue distributions; while existing analyses support the relative dominance of mid-chain compounds, they also demonstrate very low absolute abundance of waxes (Berke et al., 2019, Thomas et al., 2016). This complicates the current distributions-based paradigm for interpreting arctic sedimentary plant wax records. More observations of arctic plants are thus essential to support the confident attribution of sedimentary wax homologues to their plant sources.
Second, this approach typically assumes minimal differences in apparent fractionation factors between aquatic and terrestrial plants. At present there are few studies reporting δ2H values of aquatic plant biomass and source water to validate this assumption (Aichner et al., 2010b, Aichner et al., 2017). Aichner et al. (2017) found the average εapp between the mid-chain alkanes (n-C23 to n-C27) of a common pondweed and lake water to be broadly similar to the global average εapp calculated from sedimentary n-C29 alkanes and precipitation (−136 ± 9‰ vs. −121 ± 18‰ respectively), but also that isotopic fractionation strongly increased with increasing salinity. More data are available on the εapp between sedimentary mid-chain waxes and lake water (Huang et al., 2004, Mügler et al., 2008, Aichner et al., 2010b, Polissar and Freeman, 2010, Guenther et al., 2013, Shanahan et al., 2013, McFarlin et al., 2019), but the source(s) of sedimentary waxes are ambiguous in these datasets, and mid-chain compounds do not clearly represent input from aquatic plants alone. For example, the δ2H values of mid-chain homologues in modern sediments on Greenland do not consistently correlate with lake water, but do correlate with precipitation, suggesting the dominant input of these waxes is from terrestrial plants (McFarlin et al., 2019). Ladd et al. (2018) similarly found generally poor correlation between sedimentary n-alkanoic acid and lake water δ2H values. In other regional studies, a high correlation between the δ2H values of some sedimentary mid-chain homologues and lake water is demonstrated, but in these sites lake water is also highly correlated to precipitation so the source water is ambiguous (Huang et al., 2004, Guenther et al., 2013). Further investigation of modern aquatic plant waxes and their relation to source waters will thus contribute to more confident interpretations of arctic paleoclimate records.
The compound-specific carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of plant waxes offers additional insight into sedimentary waxes’ biological sources (Aichner et al., 2010a, Diefendorf and Freimuth, 2017, Freimuth et al., 2020). Globally, plant δ13C values vary significantly between the C3, C4, and CAM photosynthetic pathways (Farquhar et al., 1989, Collister et al., 1994), and sedimentary plant wax δ13C values have most frequently been used to reconstruct shifts between C3 and C4 vegetation along with the climatic drivers of these shifts (e.g. Tierney et al., 2010, Feakins et al., 2013, Polissar et al., 2019). However, in localities where C4 vegetation is absent, the δ13C values of plant waxes can reflect other differences in taxonomy or growth form, including a distinction between terrestrial and aquatic vegetation (Chikaraishi and Naraoka, 2003, Aichner et al., 2010a, Liu et al., 2015, Diefendorf and Freimuth, 2017), the latter of which reflects δ13C values of the dissolved inorganic carbon species it can access from its growth water (Aichner et al., 2010a). Consequently, the δ13C values of sedimentary plant waxes can sometimes be used as another independent constraint on the wax homologues’ biological sources, providing insight into the significance of ecological changes to the δ2H record of hydroclimate in sedimentary archives (e.g. Freimuth et al., 2019). Because few δ13C values of modern arctic plants are reported, the potential for δ13C values to constrain sedimentary plant waxes’ sources also remains an open question in the region.
In this study, we characterize wax δ2H values in plants from a single small region that have therefore grown under similar hydrologic and climatic conditions, and discuss the variability we observe in the distribution and isotopic composition of these compounds across taxonomic groups and growth forms. We examine the n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid homologue distributions, δ2H values, and δ13C values of modern terrestrial and aquatic plants collected from west Greenland, contributing new observations to a limited dataset for the region.

LSL and the surrounding west Greenland region experience dry conditions (Yde et al., 2018) with \<300 mm of average annual precipitation from 2001 to 2012 (Mernild et al., 2015). From 1991 to 2000, summer temperatures averaged 9.3 °C while winter temperatures averaged −18 °C (Box, 2002). In summer months, the Kangerlussuaq area receives 19–24 h of daily sunlight (Cappelen et al., 2001). Local vegetation is broadly classified as dwarf shrub (Betula nana, Salix glauca) tundra (Nielsen, 2010).
Bird Lake (BRD, also known as Sea Tomato Lake), Lake Helen (LHN), Seahorse Lake (SHL), and Lake W2 (W2) (informal names) are small lakes near the town of Kangerlussuaq where additional aquatic plant, planktonic algae, and Nostoc (colonial cyanobacteria) samples were collected to supplement the sample set from LSL (Fig. 1A). BRD, W2, and LHN are non-glacial lakes located ∼33 km northeast, ∼22 km northeast, and ∼20 km southwest of LSL, respectively. SHL is a glacial lake located ∼20 km northeast of LSL and is ∼1 km from the closest margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. These lake waters display a wide range in δ2H values, ranging from −88 to −224‰ (Table 1).

<h3> 2.2. Sample collection </h3>
Samples were collected in July and August of 2015 and 2016. In 2016, it was noted that the summer was drier than 2015, with a visibly lower lake level at LSL and 2H-enriched lake water (Table 1). Twenty-four (n = 24) vascular terrestrial plant samples were collected at LSL in 2015, one every 10 m along 50-m transects starting at the shoreline and extending away from the lakeshore in each cardinal direction (Fig. 1B). The terrestrial plant sample set was composed of Salix spp. (n = 8), Betula nana (n = 6), Pyrola grandiflora (n = 1), and Rhododendron lapponicum (n = 1); herbs Equisetum arvense (n = 1), Cerastium alpinum (n = 1), and Campanula rotundifolia (n = 1); and graminoids Carex spp. (n = 4) and a graminoid sample that could not be confidently identified (n = 1). Each terrestrial plant sample consisted of multiple cuttings of stem and leaf (with only leaves used for wax analyses of terrestrial plants; see Section 2.3). Plants collected at each sampling location represented the dominant plant species at that location. Multiple individuals of the same species were sampled at each location to be extracted together, in order to integrate across individual organisms. Aquatic plants were collected from LSL where they could be found (n = 4). Aquatic samples were identified as submerged/floating plants Myriophyllum sibiricum (n = 2) and Potamogeton sp. (n = 2). Additional samples of the emergent aquatic plant Hippuris vulgaris (n = 2), the submerged/floating plants Myriophyllum sp. (n = 1), Potamogeton sp. (n = 1), an unidentified accumulation of microalgae from the littoral zone (n = 1), and living Nostoc colonies (n = 2) were collected in 2016 from nearby lakes BRD, LHN, SHL, and/or W2 (see Table 1). Although algae and Nostoc are not plants, they have been included in this study because they incorporate lake water and produce several of the wax homologues commonly included in sedimentary plant wax paleoclimate studies. Plant identification was performed in the field when possible and confirmed during sample processing (Rune, 2011).
Sediment collection is described in detail in McFarlin et al. (2019). In brief, surface sediment was collected in the summer of 2015 and was sampled from the top ∼1 cm using an Ekman dredge. The sample was recovered with an intact sediment-water interface from the LSL depocenter (3.4 m water depth-to-bottom). All samples used in this study (plants, sediment) were collected in combusted glass jars, clean Teflon bags, or combusted Al foil. All samples were frozen immediately after sampling, shipped at ambient temperature for one to two weeks between Kangerlussuaq and Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, USA), and subsequently stored at −20 °C until analysis.
Water was collected for water isotope analysis in small capped vials. Vials were triple-rinsed in the water source, then filled and capped below the water surface. Caps were sealed with electrical tape to further prevent fractionation of water via evaporation from the vial prior to analysis. Stable isotopes (δ2H, δ18O) were measured on a Picarro Water Isotope Analyzer in 9-fold replicates and reported values are the average of the last 5 replicates in the series. Water isotope measurements were corrected to three known laboratory standards and calibrated to the VSMOW/SLAP scale

<h3> Sample preparation and lipid extraction </h3>
Plant samples were freeze dried in 60-mL glass vials using a LabConco Freezone 2.5 in preparation for lipid extraction. Plant leaves were separated from the stem where relevant (i.e. for shrubs, herbs, and leafy aquatic plants), and only leaves were extracted. Large plant leaves (e.g. long grasses) were cut into smaller pieces with solvent-washed scissors while smaller leaves (e.g. Betula nana) were left intact. Leaves were selected for extraction such that the multiple plant individuals from each sample site were equally represented.
Lipids were extracted from samples in 9:1 v/v dichloromethane:methanol (DCM:MeOH) in a CEM MARS® 5 microwave-accelerated reaction system. The temperature of reaction vessels was ramped to 100 °C over 10 min, held for 20 min, and slowly cooled. Filtered total lipid extracts (TLE) were hydrolyzed via base saponification and separated into four fractions using pre-packed Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) columns with an aminopropyl stationary phase (Supelco). n-Alkanes were eluted in 6 mL hexanes, ketones and esters in 7 mL 4:1 v/v hexanes:DCM, alcohols in 7 mL 9:1 v/v DCM:acetone, and n-alkanoic acids in 8 mL 2.5% formic acid in DCM. Alkanoic acids were derivatized for gas chromatography by esterification to n-fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs): extracts were incubated in DCM with 100 μL 12% BF3 in anhydrous MeOH at 70 °C for 10 min. As needed, n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid samples were further purified for quantification and isotope analysis using silica gel and Ag-ion column chromatography. Silica gel columns included 3 cm of stationary phase; n-alkane samples were eluted in 4 mL hexanes and n-FAME samples in 4 mL 7:1 v/v DCM:acetone, leaving behind unwanted polar compounds. Ag-ion columns (Supelco) were used to remove unsaturates from n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid fractions. n-Alkanes were eluted in 4 mL hexanes and n-alkenes in 5 mL 96:4 v/v hexanes:acetone. To remove unsaturated n-alkanoic acids, the Ag-ion chromatography scheme followed Dreiucker and Vetter (2011).

Ag-ion columns (Supelco) were used to remove unsaturates from n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid fractions. n-Alkanes were eluted in 4 mL hexanes and n-alkenes in 5 mL 96:4 v/v hexanes:acetone. To remove unsaturated n-alkanoic acids, the Ag-ion chromatography scheme followed Dreiucker and Vetter (2011).
2.4. Compound-specific lipid analyses
Lipid compound characterization and quantification was performed using a Thermo Scientific Trace 1310 gas chromatograph (GC) with a ZB5 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 0.25 µm film thickness column coupled to Flame Ionization Detector (FID) and a Thermo ISQ LT single quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS). The GC oven ramped at 6 °C/min from 100 °C to 320 °C, then held at 320 °C for 10 min. The Programmable Temperature Vaporizing injector (PTV) operated in solvent split mode with a He split flow of 10 mL/min. The FID operated at 300 °C. All lipid compounds were quantified by comparing FID peak area to a palmitic acid isobutyl ester (PAIBE) standard, 10 μg of which was injected into each sample immediately prior to GC–MS analysis as an internal quantification standard. Compounds were identified by comparing mass fragments to NIST and internal libraries and by comparing retention times to the internal standard.
Compound-specific hydrogen (δ2H) and carbon (δ13C) isotope analyses were performed using a Thermo Scientific Trace 1310 gas chromatograph with a ZB5-5MS 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 1 μm film thickness column coupled to a Thermo Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer via pyrolysis or combustion interfaces controlled by a Thermo GC-C III. The GC oven ramped at 12 °C/min from 100 to 205 °C, then at 5.5 °C/min from 205 to 275 °C, and finally at 3 °C/min from 275 to 330 °C before holding at 330 °C for 6 min. The PTV operated in solvent split mode with a He split flow of 10 mL/min and a column flow rate of 1.4 mL/min. Compound pyrolysis for δ2H measurements was performed by passing through a 1420 °C alumina (Al2O3) column. Online combustion for δ13C measurements was performed with a trace oxygen bleed over an oxidizing reactor consisting of 2XCu/Ni/Pt 0.1 mm wire bundle held at 940 °C for quantitative oxidation to CO2. H3+ factor corrections were performed daily during δ2H analytical periods (Sessions et al., 2001), with an average value of 4.464 ppm/nA. In the final analytical period, linearities in δ2H composition were checked against the B5 n-alkane standard mixture (A. Schimmelmann, Indiana University), containing 15 compounds (n-C16–n-C30). Here we report δ2H values measured at peak amplitudes >1000 mV. Sample δ2H values were normalized to the VSMOW/SLAP scale by comparison with the A6 and A7 standard mixtures (A. Schimmelmann, Indiana University), containing 15 n-alkane compounds (n-C16–n-C30) ranging in δ2H values from −263.0 to −9.1‰ VSMOW, and/or the F8 standard mixture (A. Schimmelmann, Indiana University), containing 4 methyl- and 4 ethyl esters of n-alkanoic acids (n-C14–n-C20 evens) ranging in δ2H values from −231.2 to −166.7‰ VSMOW. The given standard was run every set of three sample duplicates, and the average value of each compound measured against tank hydrogen was plotted against the respective known VSMOW value. A linear regression was plotted, and the calculated slope and intercept were then applied to normalize sample measurements to the VSMOW scale. No drift in measured values of standards was evident during the duration of any analytical period. Root mean square error for standard δ2H calibrations was better than 5‰. Sample δ13C values were also calibrated to the VPDB/LSVEC scale by analysis of the A6 and A7 mixtures, in which the 15 compounds range from −34.0 to −26.2‰ VPDB, and the F8 mixture, with 8 compounds ranging from −23.24 to −30.68‰ VPDB. Root mean square error for standard δ13C calibrations was better than 0.18‰. Finally, δ2H and δ13C values of derivatized n-alkanoic acids were corrected to account for the hydrogen and carbon isotopic composition of the added methyl group. Briefly, the BF3:MeOH mixture was used to derivatize a phthalic acid of known isotopic composition (A. Schimmelmann, Indiana University), and δ2H and δ13C values of methyl addition were calculated according to mass balance. From these values, the δ2H and δ13C values of original fatty acids were calculated. When abundance data are reported for a given compound but CSIA data are not, the sample size was too small to achieve acceptable peak intensity for isotopic measurement (1000 mV).

<h3> 2.5. Principal component analyses </h3>
Principal component analysis (PCA) of homologue abundance data was conducted using the R packages FactoMineR and Factoextra. Values were scaled from 0 to 1 manually (such that 100% relative abundance is represented as 1), and samples with any missing data (i.e. some homologues where data could not be measured) were excluded from analysis.

<h3> 3.1. Wax abundance by source </h3>
Alkanes (n-C18–n-C31) and alkanoic acids (n-C14–n-C30) are detected in most samples. Odd n-alkanes n-C21–n-C31 and even n-alkanoic acids n-C20–n-C30 are discussed here: although n-C14, n-C16, and n-C18 alkanoic acids are produced in abundance by plants, they can be contributed to the sedimentary record by a wide variety of biological sources (e.g. Stahl and Klug, 1996, Wakeham et al., 2003, Zink et al., 2008, Dubois-Brissonnet et al., 2016, Reimer et al., 2019), making their analysis as plant wax compounds in δ2H records potentially misleading. Thus, these compounds as well as even n-alkanes, odd n-alkanoic acids, and all homologues \< n-C20 are not discussed in the text (data from these compounds are provided in SI). All terrestrial plants (n = 24) exhibit an odd-over-even preference in their n-alkane homologue distributions and an even-over-odd preference in n-alkanoic acid distributions. Among aquatic wax sources, 7 plants exhibit a clear odd-over-even preference in n-alkanes, 2 plants do not exhibit a preference, and the 2 Nostoc and 1 algae sample exhibit an even-over-odd preference. All aquatic wax sources exhibit an even-over-odd preference in n-alkanoic acids.
Here, we use the expression “absolute abundance” to refer to the abundance of a given homologue in micrograms per gram of dry sample. We use “proportional abundance” to refer to the proportion of a single homologue’s abundance relative to the abundance of all analyzed homologues within the given sample. For example, a sample’s proportional abundance of n-C23 is calculated by the following equation:

Terrestrial plants have an average total abundance of all analyzed n-alkanes (i.e. the sum of odd-numbered n-alkanes C21–C31) of 320 μg/g dry sample (SD = 196). These values range from 80 μg/g dry sample in P. grandiflora to 980 μg/g dry sample in R. lapponicum, with all Salix spp. and B. nana samples yielding between 200 and 600 μg/g dry sample. Aquatic plants have an average total abundance of all n-alkanes of 110 μg/g dry sample (SD = 260). The absolute abundance of n-alkanes from aquatic sources ranges from less than 10 μg/g dry sample in Nostoc to 910 μg/g in one of two samples of the emergent aquatic plant H. vulgaris; the other H. vulgaris sample has only 95 μg n-alkanes/g dry sample. For n-alkanoic acids, terrestrial plants have an average total abundance of all analyzed homologues (i.e. the sum of even-numbered n-alkanoic acids C20–C30) of 200 μg/g dry sample (SD = 121). n-Alkanoic acid abundances range from 40 μg/g dry sample in E. arvense to 460 μg/g dry sample in B. nana. Aquatic plants have an average total abundance of 40 μg/g dry sample (SD = 48). These values range from less than 10 μg/g dry sample in Nostoc to 140 μg/g in one Potamogeton sp. sample. There is only a weak positive correlation between total n-alkane and total n-alkanoic acid abundance in corresponding samples (r2 = 0.23).
For every n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid homologue, the average absolute abundance in terrestrial plants is equal to or higher than in aquatic wax sources (Fig. 2). n-C21 and n-C23 alkanes show the least difference in absolute abundance between terrestrial and aquatic wax sources, for which terrestrial plant abundance is \<1.5× that of aquatic sources (Fig. 2A). n-C21 alkane abundance is very low in both groups, averaging 3 μg/g dry sample for both terrestrial and aquatic sources. Among n-alkanes, the greatest difference in absolute abundance between aquatic and terrestrial plants is observed in n-C31 alkane: terrestrial plant abundance is on average 70 μg/g dry sample, 100× the abundance in submerged aquatic plants. One of two emergent aquatic plant H. vulgaris samples diverges significantly from submerged aquatic plant abundances in this dataset, with n-alkane homologue abundances (n-C21 to n-C25, n-C31) and maxima (n-C27, n-C29) similar to terrestrial plant averages. The other H. vulgaris sample is very similar to aquatic plant averages in absolute and proportional abundances. Among alkanoic acids, the most similar absolute abundance between terrestrial and aquatic wax sources is observed in n-C20 alkanoic acid, with terrestrial plant abundance equal to 2× aquatic source abundance (Fig. 2B). The greatest difference is observed in n-C26 alkanoic acid, with terrestrial source abundance on average 8× the aquatic source abundance. The absolute abundance of n-alkanoic acid homologues in H. vulgaris is more similar to submerged aquatic plants than to terrestrial plants.

On average, terrestrial plants have greater proportional abundance of longer n-alkane homologues and are dominated by n-C27 alkane (Fig. 2C). Aquatic wax sources have greater proportional abundance of shorter homologues and are dominated by n-C23 alkane. Ranges of proportional abundance values are large for both terrestrial and aquatic plants in both compound classes, and the most extreme proportional abundance value is found in one H. vulgaris sample, with n-C27 alkane comprising 77% of its total odd n-alkanes. The proportional abundance data for n-alkanoic acids demonstrate that the average distributions of homologues in terrestrial and aquatic wax sources are nearly identical (though ranges of values around the average are large) (Fig. 2D). The proportional abundance of n-alkanoic acid homologues in H. vulgaris is more biased toward n-C26–n-C30 alkanoic acids than in submerged aquatic plants, but the majority of H. vulgaris proportional abundance measurements fall within the middle quartiles of aquatic plant data.
Modern (surface) sediments from LSL, previously examined in McFarlin et al. (2019), have an average total abundance of all analyzed odd n-alkanes (n-C21–C33) of ∼6 μg/g dry sediment and an average total abundance of all analyzed even n-alkanoic acids (n-C20–C30) of ∼15 μg/g dry sediment. Sedimentary n-alkanes express an odd-over-even preference, but no one homologue is dominant: the largest peaks are n-C25 and n-C27 (both are present at ∼1.5 μg/g dry sediment and together represent 44% of all odd alkanes n-C21–C33 in sediments), followed closely by n-C23 and n-C29 (both are present at ∼1 μg/g dry sediment and together represent 35% of all alkanes n-C21–n-C33 in sediments). Sedimentary n-alkanoic acids express a strong even-over-odd preference and a dominant peak at n-C24 alkanoic acid (present at ∼5 μg/g dry sediment and representing 32% of all even alkanoic acids n-C20–n-C30 in sediments) (Supplemental Information, Fig. S1).

<h3> 3.2. Wax isotopic composition by source </h3>

Aquatic plants in this study were collected from 5 lakes whose waters had different hydrogen isotopic compositions. Therefore, to compare plants across sites, we use apparent fractionation values (εapp) between the δ2H values of measured homologues and those of source water. εapp is calculated using the equation
